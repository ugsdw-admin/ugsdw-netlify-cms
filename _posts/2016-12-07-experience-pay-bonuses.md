Don’t miss the opportunity to earn experience pay for the Fall 2016 semester!
Our contract requires that you work at least 110 hours this semester in order
to qualify for a bonus.  Hours worked before the contract went into effect
count towards this amount.

[We’ve posted instructions](/members/bonuses/) for how to check your hours.  You should have around
85 hours through the November 30th pay stub.

As a reminder, bonus amounts for this semester are $0.25 for each hour worked.
If you work 110 hours exactly, that translates to a bonus of $27.50.  The bonus
will be included in the last paycheck of the semester, which you should receive
on January 15.

[E-mail us](mailto:ugsdw.org@gmail.com) with any questions about experience pay or the contract.
