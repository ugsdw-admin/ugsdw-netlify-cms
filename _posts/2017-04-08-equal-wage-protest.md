title: 'Equal Wage Protest '
author: Cory McCartan

On **Monday, April 10**, UGSDW will be outside the dining hall protesting the College's treatment of high school workers.  

There are about a dozen students from Grinnell High School who work in the dining hall. They do the same kind of work as their college-aged counterparts, and often have more experience and work more hours per week. But they have been left out to dry by the College administration, which refuses to pay them the contract-mandated higher wage.

Grinnell won't go through the arbitration process in the contract, and also won't pay the high school students the wages they are due.  We must stand together and speak out to make them do the right thing.

## Timeline: Monday, April 10

- **11:30 a.m.** Set up.
- **11:50 a.m.** Meet outside the dining hall
- **11:55 a.m.** Begin protest. Hand out pamphlets, have people sign the petition, make noise!
- **12:30 p.m.** End protest.
